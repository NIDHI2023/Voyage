What is the back story?
You, the player, cannot help but follow the irresistible call of adventure. With her cat that can sniff out treasure (in the form of a golden shimmering key...) they leave everything they have ever known with nothing but the clothes on their backs in search of the hidden key, rumored to be in a far off land.

What are the controls?
Tab - Switch between characters
Left/right arrow keys - run backwards/forwards Space - jump, if pressed twice double jump Left shift - Sprint
What are the game mechanics you are using? Describe them and why did you choose them as your game mechanics?
Many of the game mechanics are inspired by the simple platforming games on Coolmathgames.com, namely Fireboy and Watergirl. The player will be able to toggle between the cat and the human and control them separately, though an alternate method could have been taking two inputs for each player. Each character has their own separate abilities: the cat can move faster but cannot double jump and the human can double jump but is slower. This was added so there is a sense of balance between the two characters. There will be segments where one has to stand on a button or flip a lever for the other to proceed, and these were added because they felt more involved and creative in the game. There is also a part in level 3 where the cat has to press a series of buttons to make a pathway for the human to be able to cross and reach the end. By figuring out the human’s trivia part, the player will know what platform to jump on for the cat, avoiding more unnecessary restarts. In this way, the user is forced to figure out how both characters can be utilized to beat the game.

What is the gameplay loop, the secondary gameplay loop of your game? Explain them in as much detail as you can. Are there any tertiary gameplay loops?
Run -> Jump -> Switch characters
The first gameplay loop is very basic and covers the platforming aspects of this game. It simply consists of the player’s ability to move and interact with the environment.
Explore level -> Solve puzzles -> Unlock new level
The secondary gameplay loop is achieved by moving around. As shown by the level select screen, the player has a straightforward main objective to simply move through the levels and finish the game.
